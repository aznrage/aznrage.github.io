        <h1>The Story of Napoleon Bonaparte</h1>
        <p>Napoleon Bonaparte, a name synonymous with military genius and political ambition, rose from modest beginnings to become one of history's most influential figures. This page explores the key moments of his extraordinary life.</p>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Napoleon was born on August 15, 1769, in Corsica, just months after the island was transferred to France from Genoa. His family, of noble Italian descent, was part of the minor Corsican nobility. Napoleon attended military school in mainland France, where he quickly distinguished himself as a brilliant strategist and leader.</p>

        <h2>Rise to Power</h2>
        <p>In the wake of the French Revolution, Napoleon's military acumen and ambition led him to prominence. By 1799, he had become a leading figure in the French government, orchestrating a coup d'état that established him as First Consul. His reforms and policies began to reshape France, consolidating his power.</p>

        <h2>Emperor of the French</h2>
        <p>In 1804, Napoleon declared himself Emperor of the French, solidifying his control over the nation. His reign was marked by a series of military campaigns across Europe, known as the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon's strategies led to significant victories, but also to a series of conflicts with various European coalitions.</p>

        <h2>Exile and Return</h2>
        <p>After a series of defeats and the invasion of France by allied forces, Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba in 1814. However, he escaped and returned to France for a brief period known as the Hundred Days. His final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 led to his second exile, this time to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Napoleon died on May 5, 1821, on Saint Helena. His legacy is a complex tapestry of military brilliance, controversial politics, and enduring impact on European and global history. The Napoleonic Code, a major reform of legal systems, remains influential to this day.</p>
